# Sales-Dashboard-Using-Power-BI

In this project, i have worked on creating sales DashBoard using POWER BI on sales data and tried to show insights from the data. On the way of creating this DashBoard,i have performed ETL operations on data as per the need . Power query was also used to clean and transform the data and DAX was also used for creating and calculating the measures.

Some of the steps in data cleaning:

1.deleted duplicate rows

2.deleted rows with sales_amount <=0

3.normalized currency unit

...

Once done with the calculations, i have made visualizations and created report using cards , slicer , Charts etc.
Which helps in easy understanding of the end-user and gives meaningful insights.

Tools and Technology used-
1. Microsoft Power BI
2. MYSQL
