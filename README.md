# Sales-Dashboard-Using-Power-BI

In this project, i have made an interactive Power BI Sales Dashboard on sales data and found some insights from the data. In order to build the dashboard as per the requirements, ETL process has been performed. Power query was used to clean and transform the data and DAX was also used for creating and calculating the measures.

Some of the steps in data cleaning:

1.deleted duplicate rows

2.deleted rows with sales_amount <=0

3.normalized currency unit

...

Once done with the calculations, i have made visualizations and created report using cards , slicer , Charts etc.
Which helps in easy understanding of the end-user and gives meaningful insights.

Tools and Technology used-
1. Microsoft Power BI
2. MYSQL
